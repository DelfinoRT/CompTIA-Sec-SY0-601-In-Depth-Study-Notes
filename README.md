# CompTIA-Sec-SY0-601-In-Depth-Study-Notes

## What's this about?
I just started studying to take the Security+ Certification later this year and I consider that a good way to learn is by reading and taking notes, this repository will keep the notes I take.  

 My main sources for these notes are:   
* The book "All in One CompTIA Security+ (Exam SY0-601)" by Arthur Conklin and Gregory White
* The YouTube playlist [Professor Messer SY0-601 Security+ Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NE33fpQuw8&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8)

## Contributions?
The idea if making my notes public is to have the chance to help some others folk aiming to get the certification as well, feel free to contribute in any way to improve/fix the content.
