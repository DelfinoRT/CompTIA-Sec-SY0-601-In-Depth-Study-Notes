# CompTIA-Sec-SY0-601 In-Depth-Study-Notes

## What's this about?
I just started studying to take the Security+ Certification exam later this year and I consider that a good way to learn is by reading and taking notes, this repository will keep the notes I take.  

## Exam Objectives
* Threats, Attacks and Vulnerabilities: Understanding various types of security threats, attacks, and vulnerabilities.
* Technologies and Tools: Knowledge of security technologies and tools, such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and more.
* Architecture and Design: Understanding of security architecture and design, including risk management and business continuity planning.
* Identity and Access Management: Knowledge of identity and access management concepts, including authentication, authorization, and identity federation.
* Risk Management: Understanding of risk management, including risk assessment and mitigation strategies.
* Cryptography: Knowledge of cryptography and its role in information security, including encryption and digital signatures.
* Network Security: Understanding of network security, including secure network design, secure protocols, and secure network devices.
* Compliance and Operational Security: Knowledge of compliance requirements and operational security, including security policies and procedures.
* Software Development Security: Understanding of software development security, including secure coding practices and secure software design.
* Incident Response and Disaster Recovery: Understanding of incident response and disaster recovery, including incident response planning and disaster recovery procedures

The exam measures your ability to identify and understand security concepts, install and configure systems to secure applications, networks, and devices, as well as effectively respond to security incidents.

## My main sources for these notes are:   
* The book "All in One CompTIA Security+ (Exam SY0-601)" by Arthur Conklin and Gregory White
* The YouTube playlist [Professor Messer SY0-601 Security+ Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NE33fpQuw8&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8)

## Contributions?
The idea if making my notes public is to have the chance to help some others folk aiming to get the certification as well, feel free to contribute in any way to improve/fix the content.

## Additional resources

While trying to better grab my head around the ton of security concepts, I've been browsing the Internet for more information.  
This quest has helped me find some resources that I consider are worth checking, the list will be built here:
