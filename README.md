# CompTIA-Sec-SY0-601-In-Depth-Study-Notes

## What's this about?
I just started studying to take the Security+ Certification later this year and I consider that a good way to learn is by reading and taking notes, this repository will keep the notes I take.  

 My main sources for these notes are:   
* The book "All in One CompTIA Security+ (Exam SY0-601)" by Arthur Conklin and Gregory White
* The YouTube playlist [Professor Messer SY0-601 Security+ Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NE33fpQuw8&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8)
