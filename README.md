# CompTIA-Sec-SY0-601-In-Depth-Study-Notes

## What's this about?
I just started studying to take the Security+ Certification later this year and I consider that a good way to learn is by reading and taking notes, this repository will keep the notes I take.  

## Exam Objectives
   * Network Architecture: understand the different types of network designs, topologies, and protocols.
   * Network Operations: understand network security, network monitoring, and network troubleshooting techniques.
   * Network Security: understand how to implement and maintain network security, including access control, authentication, and cryptography.
   * Network Troubleshooting and Tools: understand common network issues, troubleshooting techniques, and the tools used for network analysis.
   * Infrastructure: understand the different types of network components, their functions, and how they interconnect.
   * Network Software: understand the role of network software, including operating systems, network management, and network utilities.
   * Cloud Computing: understand cloud computing concepts, deployment models, and services.
   * Network Performance Optimization: understand how to optimize network performance and ensure network availability.
   * Industry Standards, Practices, and Network Theory: understand industry standards and practices, as well as the underlying network theory and concepts.. 

 My main sources for these notes are:   
* The book "All in One CompTIA Security+ (Exam SY0-601)" by Arthur Conklin and Gregory White
* The YouTube playlist [Professor Messer SY0-601 Security+ Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NE33fpQuw8&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8)

## Contributions?
The idea if making my notes public is to have the chance to help some others folk aiming to get the certification as well, feel free to contribute in any way to improve/fix the content.
