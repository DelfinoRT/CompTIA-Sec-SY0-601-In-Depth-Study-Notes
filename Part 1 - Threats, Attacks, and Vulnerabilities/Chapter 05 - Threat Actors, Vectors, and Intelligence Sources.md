# CompTIA SY0-501 Security+ Study Notes

## Part 1 - Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities  
### Chapter 05 - Threat Actors, Vectors, and Intelligence Sources

Threats are actions that can result in a risk to a system.  
A threat actor is the source of the threat to the system.  
Vectors are the methods that threat actors use to attack a vulnerability in a system in order to achieve their objectives.  
Threat intelligence is knowledge based on evidence that allows the prevention or mitigation of a cyber attack.  
Intruders are those who are attempting to conduct an intrusion and come in different varieties and have varying degrees of sophistication.

ðŸŸ¢ **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**  

An APT attack is characterized by using toolkits to achieve a presence on a target network and then, instead of just moving to steal information, it focuses on the long game by maintaining a persistent presence on the target and avoiding detection.  

ðŸŸ¢ **Insider Treats**  

Most security is designed to protect against outside intruders and thus the protection usually lies at the boundary between the organization and the rest of the world.  
Insiders have the access and knowledge necessary to cause immediate damage to an organization.  
Attacks by insiders are often the result of employees who have become disgruntled with their organization and are looking for ways to disrupt operations. It is also possible that an "attack" by an insider may be an accident and not intended as an attack at all.  
Employees are not the only insiders who organizations need to be concerned about. Often numerous other individuals have physical access to company facilities such as contractors or partners, custodial crews, maintenance crews, etc.
