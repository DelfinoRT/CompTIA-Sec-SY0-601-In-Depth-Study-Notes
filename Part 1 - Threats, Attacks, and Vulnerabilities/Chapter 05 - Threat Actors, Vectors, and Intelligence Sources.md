# CompTIA SY0-501 Security+ Study Notes

## Part 1 - Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities  
### Chapter 05 - Threat Actors, Vectors, and Intelligence Sources

First a few definitions:
Cyber **threats** are potential dangers that could compromise a system's security.<br>
A **threat actor**, the source of such threats, utilizes various methods, known as **vectors**, to exploit system vulnerabilities for their goals. <br>
**Threat intelligence** is evidence-based knowledge that aids in preventing or mitigating cyber attacks.<br>
**Intruders**, varying in sophistication, are individuals or groups attempting unauthorized access into a system.<br>

## **Actors and Threats**

üü¢ **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**  

An Advanced Persistent Threat (**APT**) attack uses toolkits to infiltrate a target network and maintain a prolonged presence to avoid detection.<br>
Due to the intensive resources required, **APTs typically target high-value entities** like nation states or large corporations with the aim of long-term information theft, unlike the quick "hit and run" tactics of many black hat hackers.<br>
APTs typically progress in stages: <br>
1) Gaining Access
2) Establishing a Foothold
3) Deepening Access
4) Moving Laterally
5) Observing, Learning, and Remaining undetected

üü¢ **Insider Treats**  

While most security measures focus on protecting against external threats, insider threats pose a unique challenge as they **come from within the organization**.<br>
Insiders, with their access and knowledge, can cause significant damage. These threats often originate from disgruntled employees seeking to disrupt operations, but can also be unintentional.<br>
However, employees aren't the only potential insiders. Others with physical access to company facilities, like contractors, partners, and maintenance crews, should also be considered when addressing insider threats.

üü¢ **State Actors**  

**State-sponsored** hackers, often considered elite due to their highly technical skills, exploit and discover new vulnerabilities. Some work for cybersecurity firms combating cybercrime, while others operate under nation-states, running groups of skilled hackers to conduct large-scale attacks.<br>
These state actors, **typically well-funded**, primarily aim to **compromise intelligence data of other governments** and frequently **execute Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks**.<br>
Many countries now have the capability to conduct information warfare, characterized by extended preparation, significant financial support, and organized hacker groups. Potential targets for state actors include military forces, national infrastructure (water, gas, electricity, oil), refineries, distribution systems, banks, and telecommunications.

üü¢ **Hacktivists**  

**Hacktivists** are threat actors who stand a level below elite hackers. They are capable of writing scripts to **exploit known vulnerabilities**.<br>
These individuals are technically **more competent than script kiddies** and, in some cases, they may recruit script kiddies to increase the scale of an attack.<br>
Hackers who unite for a common cause or a collectivist effort are referred to as hacktivists.<br>
In simpler terms, a **hacktivist** is someone who uses hacking to effect **political and social change**. The term ‚Äúhacktivist‚Äù was first used in **1994**, originating from the hacker group, **‚ÄúCult of the Dead Cow‚Äù**.<br>

üü¢ **Script Kiddies (Skiddies)**  

On the lower end of the technical spectrum, we find individuals known as **Script Kiddies**. These individuals lack the technical expertise to develop scripts or discover new vulnerabilities in software. However, they possess just enough knowledge of computer systems to download and run scripts developed by others.<br>
It's likely that the majority of malicious activities on the internet are carried out by these individuals.<br>
Not all novice hackers are script kiddies. Some beginners strive to understand the tools they use. Conversely, script kiddies show little interest in comprehending the exploits they utilize; they opt for what's readily available and easy to find.<br>
Script kiddies are typically driven by simple, personal motives -- like having fun, creating chaos, seeking attention, or exacting revenge.<br>
The term "Script Kiddie" first surfaced in hacker magazines, blogs, message boards, and Internet Relay Chat in the **mid-1990s**.<br>


üü¢ **Criminal Syndicates**  

These are cybersecurity criminals who lurk in the shadows of anonymity, create malware and perform attacks to steal identities, financial data, and intellectual property, all with an eye on making money.  
One difference between criminal groups and the "average" hacker is the level of organization that criminal elements employ in their attacks as they typically have the money to spend on accomplishing the activity and are willing to spend extra time motivated by the level of the reward if they succeed.  
Attacks by criminal organizations usually fall into the structured threat category characterised by a greater amount of planning, a longer period of time to conduct the activity, more financial backing to accomplish it, and possibly corruption or collusion with insiders.  
Today‚Äôs criminal syndicates can benefit from national jurisdictions that do not have proper legal frameworks and technical capabilities to fight cybercrime. The easiness of communication, anonymity, and the accessibility of tools for illegal operations have transformed cybercrime into a global, fast-expanding, and profit-driven industry with organized criminal groups thriving behind it.  

## **Hackers**  

The original use of the term related to individuals who spent time trying to figure out how something worked so that they could control it in ways it was't designed.
Haker is also a term to describe anyone who improperly uses computers, including criminals. This has led to the descriptors authorized, unauthorized and semi-authorized.
