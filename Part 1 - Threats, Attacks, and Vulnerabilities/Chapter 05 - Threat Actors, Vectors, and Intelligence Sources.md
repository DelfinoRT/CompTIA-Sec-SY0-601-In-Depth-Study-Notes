# CompTIA SY0-501 Security+ Study Notes

## Part 1 - Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities  
### Chapter 05 - Threat Actors, Vectors, and Intelligence Sources

Threats are actions that can result in a risk to a system.  
A threat actor is the source of the threat to the system.  
Vectors are the methods that threat actors use to attack a vulnerability in a system in order to achieve their objectives.  
Threat intelligence is knowledge based on evidence that allows the prevention or mitigation of a cyber attack.  
Intruders are those who are attempting to conduct an intrusion and come in different varieties and have varying degrees of sophistication.  

## **Actors and Threats**

üü¢ **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**  

An APT attack is characterized by using toolkits to achieve a presence on a target network and then, instead of just moving to steal information, it focuses on the long game by maintaining a persistent presence on the target and avoiding detection.  

üü¢ **Insider Treats**  

Most security is designed to protect against outside intruders and thus the protection usually lies at the boundary between the organization and the rest of the world.  
Insiders have the access and knowledge necessary to cause immediate damage to an organization.  
Attacks by insiders are often the result of employees who have become disgruntled with their organization and are looking for ways to disrupt operations. It is also possible that an "attack" by an insider may be an accident and not intended as an attack at all.  
Employees are not the only insiders who organizations need to be concerned about. Often numerous other individuals have physical access to company facilities such as contractors or partners, custodial crews, maintenance crews, etc.  

üü¢ **State Actors**  

At the top of the spectrum are those highly technical individuals referred to as elite hackers, who not only have the ability to write scripts that exploit vulnerabilities but also are capable of discovering new ones.  
Many of these elite hackers are employed by major cybersecurity firms in an effort to combat criminal activity. Others are employed by nation-states and other international organizations, to train and run large groups of skilled hackers to conduct nation-state attacks against a wide range of adversaries.  
State actors are employed by governments to compromise or gain access to the intelligence data of targeted governments, they are typically well-funded and often carry APT attacks.  
Many nations today have developed to some extent the capability to conduct information warfare, this type of threat is characterized by a much longer period of preparation, tremendous financial backing, and a large and organized group of hackers.  
Some of the possible targets for state actors are military forces, national infrastructure (water, gas, electricity, oil), refineries, distribution systems, banks, and telecommunication. 

üü¢ **Hacktivists**  

These threat actors are usually at the level below the elite hackers and are those people who are capable of writing scripts to exploit known vulnerabilities. These individuals are much more technically competent than script kiddies and, usually, script kiddies may be enlisted as ground troops to add volume to an attack.  
When hackers work together for a collectivist effort, typically on behalf of some cause, they are referred to as hacktivists.  
Simply put, a hacktivist is someone who uses hacking to bring about political and social change. The term ‚Äúhacktivist‚Äù traces back to 1994, originating from the hacker group ‚ÄúCult of the Dead Cow.‚Äù
