# CompTIA SY0-501 Security+ Study Notes

## Part 1 - Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities  
### Chapter 05 - Threat Actors, Vectors, and Intelligence Sources

First a few definitions:
Cyber **threats** are potential dangers that could compromise a system's security.<br>
A **threat actor**, the source of such threats, utilizes various methods, known as **vectors**, to exploit system vulnerabilities for their goals. <br>
**Threat intelligence** is evidence-based knowledge that aids in preventing or mitigating cyber attacks.<br>
**Intruders**, varying in sophistication, are individuals or groups attempting unauthorized access into a system.<br>

## **Actors and Threats**

ðŸŸ¢ **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**  

An Advanced Persistent Threat (**APT**) attack uses toolkits to infiltrate a target network and maintain a prolonged presence to avoid detection.<br>
Due to the intensive resources required, **APTs typically target high-value entities** like nation states or large corporations with the aim of long-term information theft, unlike the quick "hit and run" tactics of many black hat hackers.<br>
APTs typically progress in stages: <br>
1) Gaining Access
2) Establishing a Foothold
3) Deepening Access
4) Moving Laterally
5) Observing, Learning, and Remaining undetected

ðŸŸ¢ **Insider Treats**  

While most security measures focus on protecting against external threats, insider threats pose a unique challenge as they **come from within the organization**.<br>
Insiders, with their access and knowledge, can cause significant damage. These threats often originate from disgruntled employees seeking to disrupt operations, but can also be unintentional.<br>
However, employees aren't the only potential insiders. Others with physical access to company facilities, like contractors, partners, and maintenance crews, should also be considered when addressing insider threats.

ðŸŸ¢ **State Actors**  

**State-sponsored** hackers, often considered elite due to their highly technical skills, exploit and discover new vulnerabilities. Some work for cybersecurity firms combating cybercrime, while others operate under nation-states, running groups of skilled hackers to conduct large-scale attacks.<br>
These state actors, **typically well-funded**, primarily aim to **compromise intelligence data of other governments** and frequently **execute Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks**.<br>
Many countries now have the capability to conduct information warfare, characterized by extended preparation, significant financial support, and organized hacker groups. Potential targets for state actors include military forces, national infrastructure (water, gas, electricity, oil), refineries, distribution systems, banks, and telecommunications.

ðŸŸ¢ **Hacktivists**  

A step above the script kiddies, we find **intermediate threat actors**. These individuals are considerably more **technically competent**, capable of writing scripts to exploit known vulnerabilities. They are far more advanced than script kiddies, who can sometimes be used as 'ground troops' to amplify an attack. 
When these hackers unite for a collective effort, typically in support of a cause, they are referred to as **hacktivists**. A **hacktivist** is someone who leverages hacking to effect political or social change. The term "hacktivist" can be traced back to 1994, originating from the hacker group **"Cult of the Dead Cow"**.
Hacktivism represents a blend of **activism and hacking**, often deployed as a form of civil disobedience to protest against issues like censorship, human rights violations, or other political and social matters. Despite the potentially noble intentions, hacktivism activities are **illegal** and can cause significant damage, disrupting services and leaking sensitive information. 

Therefore, it's crucial to have robust **cybersecurity measures** in place to protect against these sophisticated threats.

ðŸŸ¢ **Script Kiddies (Skiddies)**  

On the **lower end of the technical spectrum**, we find individuals known as **script kiddies**. These are individuals who lack the technical expertise to create scripts or unearth new software vulnerabilities. However, they possess just enough understanding of computer systems to download and execute scripts developed by others. 
The majority of the **'unfriendly' activities** noted on the internet are likely the work of these individuals. It's important to note that not all novice hackers fall into the script kiddies category. Some less experienced attackers strive to comprehend the tools they utilize.
In contrast, **script kiddies show no interest in learning** about the exploits they use. They prefer what's easily accessible and readily available. Their motivations are typically simple and personal, ranging from seeking fun, creating chaos, and craving attention, to exacting revenge.
The term **"script kiddie"** made its first appearance in hacker magazines, blogs, message boards, and Internet Relay Chat around the mid-1990s. It's worth mentioning that, despite their limited skill, script kiddies can still pose a threat due to the powerful exploits available online. Therefore, it's vital to maintain up-to-date system security to defend against such potential threats.


ðŸŸ¢ **Criminal Syndicates**  

These are cybersecurity criminals who lurk in the shadows of anonymity, create malware and perform attacks to steal identities, financial data, and intellectual property, all with an eye on making money.  
One difference between criminal groups and the "average" hacker is the level of organization that criminal elements employ in their attacks as they typically have the money to spend on accomplishing the activity and are willing to spend extra time motivated by the level of the reward if they succeed.  
Attacks by criminal organizations usually fall into the structured threat category characterised by a greater amount of planning, a longer period of time to conduct the activity, more financial backing to accomplish it, and possibly corruption or collusion with insiders.  
Todayâ€™s criminal syndicates can benefit from national jurisdictions that do not have proper legal frameworks and technical capabilities to fight cybercrime. The easiness of communication, anonymity, and the accessibility of tools for illegal operations have transformed cybercrime into a global, fast-expanding, and profit-driven industry with organized criminal groups thriving behind it.  

## **Hackers**  

The original use of the term related to individuals who spent time trying to figure out how something worked so that they could control it in ways it was't designed.
Haker is also a term to describe anyone who improperly uses computers, including criminals. This has led to the descriptors authorized, unauthorized and semi-authorized.
