## **Wireless** 

ðŸŸ¢ **Evil Twin**  

The main directive is to get victims to connect to the attacker's network instead of the victim's network by using the attacker's "cloned" access point (this is the evil twin) instead of a legitimate access point, the evik twins are usually enhanced with high-power and high-gain antennas to look like a better connection.  
Once the attacker clones a legitimate AP, attacker makes thar AP (the evil twin) visible to others in an attempt to trick people associating with it.  
Usually an evil twin is visible to the victims at the same time that a DoS attack is taking place to force users to disconnect from their legitimate network and use the evil twin instead.  

ðŸŸ¢ **Rouge Access Point**  

It is an ilegitimate AP (Access Point) that is physically plugged to a network to create a bypass from the outsite into a ligitimate network, typically used to perform MITM attacks to redirect the traffic from the victim's device to the network router but passing through the rouge access point.   
A rouge point, being ilegitimate is not administered by the network owner.  
As the AP is already part of a network, the attacker does not need to make it visible or advertise it in any way.
