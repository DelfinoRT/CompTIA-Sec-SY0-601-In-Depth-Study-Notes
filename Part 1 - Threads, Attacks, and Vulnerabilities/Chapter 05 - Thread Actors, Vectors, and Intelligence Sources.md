# CompTIA SY0-501 Security+ Study Notes

## Part 1 - Threads, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities  
### Chapter 05 - Thread Actors, Vectors, and Intellingence Sources

Threads are actions that can resu;lt in rist to a system.  
A thread actor is the source of the thread to the system.  
Vectors are the methods that thread actors use to attack a vulnerability in a system in order to achieve their objectives.  
Thread intelligence is knowledge based on evidence that allows the prevention or mitigation of a cyber attack.

ðŸŸ¢ **Evil Twin**  

The main directive is to get victims to connect to the attacker's network instead of the victim's network by using the attacker's "cloned" access point (this is the evil twin) instead of a legitimate access point, the evil twins are usually enhanced with high-power and high-gain antennas to look like a better connection.  
Once the attacker clones a legitimate AP, attacker makes thar AP (the evil twin) visible to others in an attempt to trick people associating with it.  
Usually an evil twin is visible to the victims at the same time that a DoS attack is taking place to force users to disconnect from their legitimate network and use the evil twin instead.
