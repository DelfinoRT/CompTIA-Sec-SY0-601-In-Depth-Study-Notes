# CompTIA SY0-501 Security+ Study Notes

## Part 1 - Threads, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities  
### Chapter 01 - Social Engineering Techniques  
* Social engineering is a method of using people as part of an attack process.  
* The key in all social engineering attacks is that you are manipulating a person and their actions by manipulating their perception of a situation.  
* A social engineer preys on people's beliefs, biases, and stereotypes.  
* This is hacking the human side of a system, isan attack agains the user and involves some form of ocial interaction.
* The best defense agains social engineering attacks is a comprehensive training and awareness program.  
* The tools to perform social engineering attacks are based on a knowledge of psychology and usually don't require a sophisticted knowledge of software or hardware.

游릭 **Phishing**  

Is when an attacker attempts to obtain sensitive information (such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers and details about the user's bank accounts) from users by masquerading as a trusted entity in an e-mail or instant message sent to a large group of often random users.  
The message encourages the user to visit a website that appears to be for a reputable entity.   
The information gathered by the attacker is oftenly used to steal the user's money, credentials or identity.  
Phishing is the most common form of social engineering attacks related to computer security.  

游릭 **Smishing**  

It is a version of phishing and the an attack is performed using Short Message Service (SMS).  
The SMS usually directs the user to a website that can serve as a vector for different attack types including malware injection.  
This attack works primarily due to the use of urgency and intimidation in the message.  

游릭 **Vishing**  

It is another variation of phishing that uses voice communication to obtain information from the target.  
This technique takes advantage of the trust that some people place in the telephone network.  
We must be aware that attackers can spoof (simulate) calls from legitimate entities using VoIP technology.  

游릭 **Spam**  

Spam references to bulk unsolicited e-mail, this email can be malicious and could include attachments that contain malicious software designed to harm systems or link to malicious websites.  

游릭 **Spam over Instant Messaging (SPIM)**  

It is basically spam delivered via instant messaging applications, the purpose of hostile SPIM is the same as that of spam.  

游릭 **Spear Phishing**  

This refers to a phishing attack that targets a specific person or group of people with something in common.  
Usually the attack is customized to the target after previous data gathered from that user or group.  

游릭 **Dumpster Diving**  

This is the process of going through a target's trash searching for valuable information that might be used in an attack.  
To reduce risks, an organization should have policies about discarting materials. Sensitive information should be shredded and the organization should consider securing the trash receptacle so that individuals can't forage through it.

游릭 **Shoulder Surfing**  

When an attacker directly observes the individual entering sensitive information on  form, key, pad, or keyboard.  

游릭 **Pharming**  

This attack consists of misdirecting users to fake websites made to look official, usually done after a phising attack.  
The user will be directed to the fgake website as a result of another attach technique such as DNS poisoning or modification of local host files.  

游릭 **Tailgating**  

Is the action of following closely behind a person who has just used their accesses to a room or building.  
This method relies on poor security practices in order to be successful.  

游릭 **Eliciting(Obtaining) Information**  

Calls to or from help desk and tech support units can be used to elicit information.  
This technique aims to convince people to perform tasks resulting in security compromises.  
Posing as an employee, an attacker can get a password reset or information about the target systems.  

游릭 **Whaling**  

High-value targets are referred to as "whales".  
A whaling attack is where a target is a high-value person (such as a CEO, CFO, or CTO) and it is custom build to increase the odds of success.  

游릭 **Prepending**  

This refers to adding something else to the beginning of an item, supplying information that the target will act upon before they even ask for that information in an attempt to legitimize the actual request coming later.  
This is a way to justify why the target should perform a specific action.  

游릭 **Identity Fraud**  

This is the use of fake credentials to achieve an end.  
Examples: Pretending to be an official representative of a government agency, a regulator, lower risk person, contractor or the person that waters the plants.   
This works best when the target is expecting the impersonated individual.  

游릭 **Invoice Scams**  

Using a fake invoice in an attempt to get a company or entity to pay for things that were not ordered.  
Usually the fake invoice is accompanied with a message suggesting a sense of urgency, a final notice, or a thread.  

游릭 **Credential Harvesting**  
Involves the collection of credential information (such as user ID, password, etc) enabling an attacker a series of access to a system.  
A common form of credential harvesting starts with a phising e-mail that convices a user to click a link.  
The objective is just to obtain credentials. Once the attacker has tricket the target, they will either redirect the user to the correct website or provide an error and a new connection to the correct website, this is a way to mask the attack.  

游릭 **Reconnaissance**  

This happens when an attacker examines the sytems they intend to attack using a wide range of method like google searches, public records, OSINT, social media, surveying a company's org charts, calling and asking for information, reading press releases, etc.   
The goal is to gather as much information as possible about the system and environment that will be under attack.  \

游릭 **Hoax**  

a hoax can be damaging if it causes users to take some actions that weakens the security of a system.  
Users should be trained to be suspicious of unusual e-mails and stories and should validate the information with the system administrators or the company's security entities.  

游릭 **Impersonation**  

When an attacker directly observes the individual entering sensitive information on  form, key, pad, or keyboard.

游릭 **Shoulder Surfing**  

When an attacker directly observes the individual entering sensitive information on  form, key, pad, or keyboard.
