ðŸŸ¢ **Phishing**  

Is when an attacker attempts to obtain sensitive information (such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers and details about the user's bank accounts) from users by masquerading as a trusted entity in an e-mail or instant message sent to a large group of often random users.  
The message encourages the user to visit a website that appears to be for a reputable entity.   
The information gathered by the attacker is oftenly used to steal the user's money, credentials or identity.
