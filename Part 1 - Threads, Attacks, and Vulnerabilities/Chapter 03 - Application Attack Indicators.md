## Part 1 - Threads, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities  
### Chapter 03 - Application Attack Indicators 


üü¢ **Privilege Escalation**  
Most attacks begin at a privilege level associated with an ordinary user. From this level, the attacker exploits vulnerabilities that enable them to achive root or admin level access. This step is called privilege escalation.  
The act of exploiting a bug, a design flaw, or a configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user.  
A method to limit the attack surface of this attack is to reduce the processes and services that run in elevated mode.  

üü¢ **Cross-Site Scripting**  
This is one of the most common attack methodologies.   
The cause of the vulnerability is weak user input validation. If input is not validated properly, an attacker can include a script in the inputs and have it rendered as part of the web process.  
Input validation (data validation) is used to prevent XSS attacks.  
There are different types of XSS attacks:  
  * **Non-persistent XSS attack**: The injected script is not persisted or stored but rather is immediately executed and passed back via the web server.
  * **Persisten XSS attack**: The script is permanently stored on the web server or some back-end storage, this allows the script to be used against others who access the system.
  * **DOM-based XSS attack**: The script is executed in the browser via the Document Object Model (DOM) process as opposed to the web server.

Common uses:
  * Theft of authentication information from a web application
  * Session hijacking
  * Deploying hostile content
  * Changing user settings, including feature users
  * Impersonating a user
  * Phishing or stealing sensitive information  

## **Injection Attacks**  

This happens when untrusted (unvalidated) inputs or unauthorized code are ‚Äúinjected‚Äù into an application and interpreted as part of a query or command. The result is an alteration of the software, redirecting it for a nefarious purpose.

üü¢ **SQL Injection**  (Structured Query Language)
Is a form of code injection aimed at any SQL-based database. 
An example of this attack is where the function takes the user-provided inputs for username and password and substitutes them in a **where** clause of a SQL statement with the express purpose of changing the **where** clause into one that gives a false answer to the query.  
The addition of **or** clauses, with an **always true** statement and the beginning of a comment line to block the trialing single quptes, alters the SQL statement to one in which the **where** clause is rendered inoperable, this might lead to a data breach if the **where** clause is altered to return records.  

Stored procedures are precompiled methods implemented within the database engine and act as a secure coding mechanism to isolate user input from the actual SQL statements being executed, this is one way to defend agains SQL injection.  

üü¢ **DLL Injection**  (Dynamic-Link-Library)
A DLL is a piece of code that can add functionality to a program through the inclusion of library routines linked at runtime.  
DLL injection is the process of adding to a program a DLL that has a specific functon vulnerability that can be capitalized upon by the attacker.  

üü¢ **LDAP Injection**  (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
LDAP injection can be used to execute arbritrary commands in a directory system when an application constructs an LDAP request based on user input.  
This technique is used to exploit web applications which could reveal sensitive user information or modify information stored in the LDAP directory.  

üü¢ **XML Injection**  (Extensible Markup Language)
XML injections can be used to manipulate an XML-based system and can cause the system configuration, changes in data streams, changes in outputs, etc.  
This occurs when user-supplied input isn't validated or sanitized before it is added to a web application's XML documents; then they are processed and executed.
